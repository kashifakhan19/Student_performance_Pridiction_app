## 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts student performance (score) using a trained Machine Learning model.
It considers various factors such as:

Hours of study

Previous scores

Sleep duration

Number of practice/sample papers solved

Involvement in extracurricular activities

The model is trained using Scikit-learn, and the application provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time prediction.

## 🚀 Features

✅ User-friendly Streamlit UI
✅ Prediction based on multiple input factors
✅ Uses Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
✅ Pre-trained model (Student_performance.pkl)
✅ Input scaling with scaler.pkl

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Joblib
